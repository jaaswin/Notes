# RESISTOR

## 1. Definition

A **resistor** is a passive electrical component that **opposes the flow of electric current** in a circuit. Its main function is to **control current**, **divide voltage**, and **protect components** by converting electrical energy into heat.

---

## 2. Principle of operation

When a voltage is applied across a conductor, electrons start moving.
In a resistive material, electrons collide with atoms and lattice ions. These collisions:

* Reduce electron speed
* Oppose current flow
* Convert electrical energy into **thermal energy (heat)**

This opposition to current flow is called **resistance**.

## 3. Unit and symbol

* Unit of resistance: **Ohm (Ω)**
* Symbol: Zig-zag line (or rectangle in IEC standard)

---

## 4. Ohm’s Law

The voltage across a resistor is directly proportional to the current flowing through it, provided temperature remains constant.

[
V = IR
]

Where:

* (V) = Voltage (Volts)
* (I) = Current (Amperes)
* (R) = Resistance (Ohms)

## 5. Types of resistors

### (a) Fixed resistors

* Carbon composition
* Carbon film
* Metal film
* Wire-wound

### (b) Variable resistors

* Rheostat
* Potentiometer

### (c) Special resistors

* Thermistor (temperature dependent)
* LDR (light dependent)
* Varistor (voltage dependent)

## 6. Behavior in DC circuits

* Current is constant
* Voltage drop is fixed
* No energy storage
* Power dissipated as heat

Power equations:
[
P = VI = I^2R = \frac{V^2}{R}
]

---

## 7. Behavior in AC circuits

* Voltage and current are **in phase**
* No frequency effect
* Impedance equals resistance:
  [
  Z = R
  ]
* Power factor = **1**

---

## 8. Temperature effect

Resistance varies with temperature:

* Metals: resistance **increases** with temperature
* Semiconductors: resistance **decreases** with temperature

---

## 9. Power rating

Every resistor has a maximum power rating (¼W, ½W, 1W, etc.).
If exceeded:

* Resistor overheats
* Value changes or resistor burns

## 10. Role of resistor in RLC circuit

* Controls current magnitude
* Reduces oscillations (damping)
* Determines bandwidth
* Improves circuit stability

---

## 11. Applications of resistors

* Current limiting
* Voltage divider circuits
* Biasing of amplifiers
* Pull-up and pull-down resistors in digital circuits
* Heat generation (heaters)

---

## 12. Advantages and limitations

### Advantages

* Simple and reliable
* Low cost
* Easy to use

### Limitations

* Power loss as heat
* No energy storage

---

## 13. Conclusion

A resistor is a fundamental component in all electronic circuits. It ensures safe operation by controlling current and voltage, making it essential in **analog, digital, power, and communication systems**.
