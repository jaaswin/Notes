Kirchhoff’s Current Law (KCL)

Definition

Kirchhoff’s Current Law states that at any node (junction) in an electrical circuit, the algebraic sum of currents is zero.

In other words, the total current entering a node is equal to the total current leaving the node.


---

Mathematical Expression

\sum I = 0

or

\sum I_{entering} = \sum I_{leaving}


---

Physical Principle Behind KCL

KCL is based on the law of conservation of electric charge.
Charge cannot be created or destroyed at a node, so it must be conserved.

A node behaves like a strict accountant 📊
Every ampere is recorded. No losses, no extras.


---

Explanation with Example

Consider a node where:

Current  enters

Current  enters

Current  leaves


Applying KCL:

I_1 + I_2 - I_3 = 0

4 + 6 - I_3 = 0

I_3 = 10 \,A

So, 10 A must leave the node.

Sign Convention in KCL

You can choose any convention, but be consistent:

Currents entering the node → positive

Currents leaving the node → negative


(or vice versa, consistency is the key 🔑)


---

KCL in Terms of Node Voltage

Using Ohm’s Law:

I = \frac{V_{node} - V_{other}}{R}

KCL becomes the foundation of nodal analysis, where unknown node voltages are solved using current equations.
