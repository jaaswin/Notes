I²C (**Inter-Integrated Circuit**) is a **synchronous, serial, multi-master communication protocol** developed by Philips (now NXP). It is widely used in embedded systems to allow multiple integrated circuits (ICs) to communicate with each other using **only two wires**, making it simple, efficient, and cost-effective.

## 1. What is I²C?

I²C is a **serial communication protocol** where data is transferred **bit by bit** over two shared lines. Unlike UART and SPI, I²C supports **multiple master and multiple slave devices** on the same bus using a unique **addressing system**.

---

## 2. I²C Bus Lines

I²C uses only **two bidirectional lines**:

1. **SDA (Serial Data Line)**
   Transfers data between master and slave

2. **SCL (Serial Clock Line)**
   Clock signal generated by the master

Both lines are **open-drain (open-collector)** and require **pull-up resistors** connected to Vcc.

---

## 3. I²C Communication Principle

* The **master** controls communication and generates the clock.
* Slaves respond only when their **address matches**.
* Data is transferred synchronously with the clock.
* Only **one device transmits at a time**.

---

## 4. I²C Addressing

Each slave device has a **unique address**.

### Address Types:

* **7-bit addressing** (most common → 128 possible addresses)
* **10-bit addressing** (1024 addresses, rarely used)

### Address Frame:

```
| 7-bit Address | R/W Bit |
```

* **R/W = 0** → Write operation
* **R/W = 1** → Read operation

---

## 5. I²C Data Frame Format

A typical I²C data transfer consists of:

```
START → ADDRESS → ACK → DATA → ACK → STOP
```

### 1. Start Condition

* SDA transitions from HIGH to LOW while SCL is HIGH
* Indicates beginning of communication

### 2. Address Frame

* Master sends slave address + R/W bit
* Slave with matching address responds

### 3. Acknowledge (ACK)

* Receiver pulls SDA LOW during the 9th clock pulse
* Confirms successful reception

### 4. Data Transfer

* Data sent in **8-bit bytes**
* Each byte followed by ACK/NACK

### 5. Stop Condition

* SDA transitions from LOW to HIGH while SCL is HIGH
* Ends communication

---

## 6. I²C Read and Write Operations

### Write Operation:

1. Master sends START
2. Master sends slave address + Write bit
3. Slave sends ACK
4. Master sends data byte(s)
5. Slave sends ACK after each byte
6. Master sends STOP

### Read Operation:

1. Master sends START
2. Master sends slave address + Read bit
3. Slave sends ACK
4. Slave sends data byte(s)
5. Master sends ACK (or NACK for last byte)
6. Master sends STOP

---

## 7. I²C Clock Stretching

Clock stretching allows a slave to **pause communication** by holding SCL LOW if it needs more time to process data.

* Improves reliability
* Master must wait until SCL is released

## 8. I²C Bus Speeds

| Mode            | Speed               |
| --------------- | ------------------- |
| Standard Mode   | 100 kbps            |
| Fast Mode       | 400 kbps            |
| Fast Mode Plus  | 1 Mbps              |
| High-Speed Mode | 3.4 Mbps            |
| Ultra-Fast Mode | 5 Mbps (write-only) |

---

## 9. Multi-Master Capability

I²C supports **multiple masters** on the same bus.

### Arbitration:

* If two masters start transmission simultaneously:

  * Device sending a LOW wins arbitration
  * Losing master stops transmitting

This prevents data collision.

---

## 10. Advantages of I²C

* Uses only two wires
* Supports multiple devices on one bus
* Built-in addressing
* Acknowledge mechanism improves reliability
* Low pin count

---

## 11. Disadvantages of I²C

* Slower than SPI
* Limited bus length (typically < 1 meter)
* Requires pull-up resistors
* More complex protocol than UART
* Speed decreases with many devices on bus

## 12. I²C vs SPI vs UART

| Feature      | I²C    | SPI  | UART       |
| ------------ | ------ | ---- | ---------- |
| Wires        | 2      | 4+   | 2          |
| Clock        | Yes    | Yes  | No         |
| Speed        | Medium | High | Low–Medium |
| Addressing   | Yes    | No   | No         |
| Duplex       | Half   | Full | Full       |
| Multi-Master | Yes    | No   | No         |

## 13. Applications of I²C

* EEPROM memory
* RTC (Real-Time Clock)
* Temperature and pressure sensors
* IMU sensors
* LCD and OLED displays
* Power management ICs

## 14. Summary

I²C is a **simple, flexible, and efficient communication protocol** ideal for connecting multiple low-speed peripherals using minimal wiring. Its addressing and acknowledgment features make it reliable for short-distance communication inside electronic systems.
