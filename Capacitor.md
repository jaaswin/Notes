# CAPACITOR

## 1. Definition

A **capacitor** is a passive electronic component that **stores electrical energy in the form of an electric field**. It consists of **two conducting plates separated by an insulating material** called a **dielectric**.

---

## 2. Construction

A capacitor has:

* **Two metal plates** (aluminum, tantalum, etc.)
* **Dielectric material** between the plates such as:

  * Air
  * Paper
  * Ceramic
  * Mica
  * Plastic
  * Electrolyte

The dielectric prevents direct current flow while allowing electric field formation.

---

## 3. Working principle

When a voltage is applied across a capacitor:

* Electrons accumulate on one plate
* An equal positive charge appears on the other plate
* An **electric field** is established between the plates

No actual current flows through the dielectric, but **energy is stored** in the electric field.

## 4. Capacitance

Capacitance is the ability of a capacitor to store charge.

[
C = \frac{Q}{V}
]

Where:

* (C) = Capacitance (Farad)
* (Q) = Charge (Coulombs)
* (V) = Voltage (Volts)

---

## 5. Unit and symbol

* Unit: **Farad (F)**
* Practical units: µF, nF, pF
* Symbol: two parallel lines (polarized capacitors have + and −)

---

## 6. Energy stored in a capacitor

[
E = \frac{1}{2}CV^2
]

This energy is stored in the **electric field**, not as heat.

---

## 7. Behavior in DC circuits

* Initially allows current flow while charging
* After fully charged:

  * Acts as an **open circuit**
  * Blocks DC current
* Voltage across capacitor remains constant

---

## 8. Behavior in AC circuits

* Allows AC current to pass
* Opposes change in voltage
* Current **leads voltage** by 90°

### Capacitive reactance:

[
X_C = \frac{1}{2\pi f C}
]

Where (f) = frequency.

* High frequency → low reactance
* Low frequency → high reactance

---

## 9. Charging and discharging

### Charging:

* Voltage rises exponentially
* Current decreases with time

### Discharging:

* Stored energy is released to the circuit
* Voltage falls exponentially

### Time constant:

[
\tau = RC
]

---

## 10. Types of capacitors

### (a) Fixed capacitors

* Ceramic
* Electrolytic
* Tantalum
* Film
* Mica

### (b) Variable capacitors

* Air variable
* Trimmer capacitors

---

## 11. Polarized vs non-polarized capacitors

* **Polarized**: Electrolytic, tantalum (must connect correctly)
* **Non-polarized**: Ceramic, film (any direction)

---

## 12. Role of capacitor in RLC circuit

* Stores and releases energy
* Controls resonance
* Determines frequency response
* Improves filtering

---

## 13. Applications of capacitors

* Power supply filtering
* Signal coupling and decoupling
* Timing circuits
* Tuning circuits
* Energy storage
* Noise reduction

---

## 14. Advantages and limitations

### Advantages

* Stores energy
* Fast response
* Useful in AC and signal circuits

### Limitations

* Limited voltage rating
* Leakage current
* Electrolytic capacitors age over time

---

## 15. Conclusion

A capacitor is an essential electronic component used to store electrical energy, filter signals, and control voltage variations. It plays a vital role in **power electronics, communication systems, and digital circuits**.
