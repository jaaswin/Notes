## 💻 Computer Network

A computer network is a digital ecosystem where machines talk, share, and collaborate. It is a system of interconnected computers and devices that exchange data through wired or wireless communication channels. If a single computer is a brain, a network is a nervous system stretched across buildings, cities, and continents.

At its simplest, a computer network allows one device to send information to another. At its most powerful, it runs the internet, cloud computing, banking systems, and global communication.

## 🌐 Why Computer Networks Are Important

Computer networks allow:

* File sharing
* Resource sharing such as printers and storage
* Internet access
* Email and messaging
* Video conferencing
* Cloud services

Without networks, computers would be isolated islands. With networks, they become a connected world.

## 🧱 Basic Components of a Computer Network

### 1️⃣ Devices (Nodes)

These include:

* Computers
* Laptops
* Smartphones
* Servers
* Printers
* IoT devices

Each device connected to a network is called a node.

---

### 2️⃣ Transmission Media

This is how data travels.

* Twisted pair cables
* Coaxial cables
* Optical fiber
* Wi-Fi (wireless signals)

Fiber carries light pulses. Wi-Fi rides radio waves. Copper cables carry electrical signals.

### 3️⃣ Networking Devices

These guide data to its destination.

* Router → Connects different networks
* Switch → Connects devices within the same network
* Hub → Basic connection device
* Modem → Connects to internet service provider
* Access Point → Provides wireless connectivity

---

### 4️⃣ Protocols

Protocols are communication rules. They define how data is formatted, transmitted, and received.

Important protocols include:

* TCP (Transmission Control Protocol)
* IP (Internet Protocol)
* HTTP (Web communication)
* FTP (File transfer)
* SMTP (Email transfer)

Without protocols, data would be digital chaos.

## 🏗 Types of Computer Networks

### 🔹 LAN (Local Area Network)

Covers a small area such as a home, school, or office.
Fast and reliable.

### 🔹 MAN (Metropolitan Area Network)

Covers a city.

### 🔹 WAN (Wide Area Network)

Covers large geographical areas.
The Internet is the largest WAN.

### 🔹 PAN (Personal Area Network)

Connects personal devices like Bluetooth between phone and earbuds.

## 🔄 Network Topologies

Topology describes how devices are arranged.

* Bus topology
* Star topology
* Ring topology
* Mesh topology
* Tree topology

Star topology is most common in modern LANs. Mesh topology provides high reliability.

## 📦 How Data Travels in a Network

Data is broken into small units called packets.

Each packet contains:

* Source address
* Destination address
* Actual data
* Error checking information

Routers read the address and forward packets step by step until they reach the destination. It is like sending many small envelopes instead of one large parcel.

## 🔐 Network Security

Networks must be protected from threats such as:

* Hackers
* Malware
* Data theft
* Unauthorized access

Security methods include:

* Firewalls
* Encryption
* Antivirus software
* Authentication systems
* VPN

Security keeps the digital doors locked.
