Kirchhoff’s Voltage Law (KVL)

Definition

Kirchhoff’s Voltage Law states that in any closed loop of an electrical circuit, the algebraic sum of all voltages is zero.

Simply put:
Total voltage rises = Total voltage drops


---

Mathematical Expression

\sum V = 0

Physical Principle Behind KVL

KVL is based on the law of conservation of energy.
Energy supplied by sources is completely used by circuit elements like resistors, capacitors, and inductors.

A loop is like a circular journey 🔄
You start with some energy, spend it along the way, and end with nothing left.

Explanation with Simple Example

Consider a loop with:

Battery voltage = 12 V

Voltage drop across  V

Voltage drop across  V


Applying KVL:

+12 - 5 - 7 = 0

The loop balances perfectly.

Sign Convention in KVL (Very Important)

1. Choose a loop direction (clockwise or anticlockwise).


2. While moving in the loop:

From − to + of a source → +V (voltage rise)

From + to − across a resistor (direction of current) → −V (voltage drop)



3. Keep the same direction throughout.



Consistency is the secret sauce 🧠🔁

KVL with Ohm’s Law

Voltage drop across a resistor:

V = IR

So KVL equations often look like:

V - I R_1 - I R_2 = 0
