# INDUCTOR

## 1. Definition

An **inductor** is a passive electrical component that **stores electrical energy in the form of a magnetic field** when current flows through it. It opposes any **change in current** due to the phenomenon of electromagnetic induction.

---

## 2. Construction

An inductor is usually made by:

* Winding a **conductive wire (copper)** into a coil
* The coil may be wound around:

  * **Air core**
  * **Iron core**
  * **Ferrite core**

The type of core affects the inductance value and performance.

---

## 3. Working principle

The operation of an inductor is based on **Faraday’s Law of Electromagnetic Induction**.

When current flows through the coil:

* A **magnetic field** is produced around the conductor
* Any change in current changes the magnetic field
* This changing magnetic field induces a voltage that **opposes the change in current**

This opposing voltage is called **back EMF**.

## 4. Inductance

Inductance is the ability of an inductor to oppose changes in current.

[
L = \frac{N\Phi}{I}
]

Where:

* (L) = Inductance (Henry)
* (N) = Number of turns
* (\Phi) = Magnetic flux
* (I) = Current

---

## 5. Unit and symbol

* Unit: **Henry (H)**
* Practical units: mH, µH
* Symbol: coil shape

---

## 6. Energy stored in an inductor

[
E = \frac{1}{2}LI^2
]

Energy is stored in the **magnetic field** around the coil.

---

## 7. Behavior in DC circuits

* Initially opposes current when DC is applied
* Current increases gradually
* After steady state:

  * Acts like a **short circuit**
  * Offers very low resistance
* Stores magnetic energy

---

## 8. Behavior in AC circuits

* Opposes AC current

* Voltage **leads current** by 90°

* Inductive reactance:
  [
  X_L = 2\pi f L
  ]

* Higher frequency → higher reactance

* Lower frequency → lower reactance

---

## 9. Inductor current growth and decay

### Current growth:

* Current increases exponentially
* Magnetic field builds up

### Current decay:

* Stored energy is released
* Magnetic field collapses

### Time constant:

[
\tau = \frac{L}{R}
]

## 10. Types of inductors

### (a) Based on core

* Air core inductor
* Iron core inductor
* Ferrite core inductor

### (b) Based on adjustability

* Fixed inductors
* Variable inductors

## 14. Comparison with capacitor

| Inductor                        | Capacitor                       |
| ------------------------------- | ------------------------------- |
| Stores energy in magnetic field | Stores energy in electric field |
| Opposes change in current       | Opposes change in voltage       |
| Acts short for DC               | Acts open for DC                |
| Current lags voltage            | Current leads voltage           |

## 15. Conclusion

An inductor is a key component in electronic and electrical systems that control current variation, store magnetic energy, and enable resonance in AC circuits. It is widely used in **power electronics, communication systems, and signal processing**.
